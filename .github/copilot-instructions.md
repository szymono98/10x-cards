## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for STYLING

#### TAILWIND

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) mode for development efficiency and smaller CSS bundles
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Leverage the @apply directive in component classes to reuse utility combinations
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Use component extraction for repeated UI patterns instead of copying utility classes
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

#### NEXT_JS

- Use App Router and Server Components for improved performance and SEO
- Implement route handlers for API endpoints instead of the pages/api directory
- Use server actions for form handling and data mutations from Server Components
- Leverage Next.js Image component with proper sizing for core web vitals optimization
- Implement the Metadata API for dynamic SEO optimization
- Use React Server Components for {{data_fetching_operations}} to reduce client-side JavaScript
- Implement Streaming and Suspense for improved loading states
- Use the new Link component without requiring a child <a> tag
- Leverage parallel routes for complex layouts and parallel data fetching
- Implement intercepting routes for modal patterns and nested UIs

#### REACT_QUERY

- Use TanStack Query (formerly React Query) with appropriate staleTime and gcTime based on data freshness requirements
- Implement the useInfiniteQuery hook for pagination and infinite scrolling
- Use optimistic updates for mutations to make the UI feel more responsive
- Leverage queryClient.setQueryDefaults to establish consistent settings for query categories
- Use suspense mode with <Suspense> boundaries for a more declarative data fetching approach
- Implement retry logic with custom backoff algorithms for transient network issues
- Use the select option to transform and extract specific data from query results
- Implement mutations with onMutate, onError, and onSettled for robust error handling
- Use Query Keys structuring pattern ([entity, params]) for better organization and automatic refetching
- Implement query invalidation strategies to keep data fresh after mutations
